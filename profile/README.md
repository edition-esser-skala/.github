## :smiley: Welcome to the git repositories of Edition Esser-Skala :musical_note:

We are an independent, Open Content publisher focusing on sacral music by 18th century masters who have largely been forgotten.

[Our editions](https://edition.esser-skala.at/scores/) :book: base upon freely available manuscripts and prints :scroll:,
which are provided by an increasing number of [archives and libraries](https://edition.esser-skala.at/about/sources-for-digital-versions/) :classical_building:.

To ensure high and consistent quality, we follow a set of [editorial guidelines](https://edition.esser-skala.at/about/editorial-guidelines) :heavy_check_mark: when preparing our editions.
Moreover, we have implemented a largely automated engraving and publishing process :hammer_and_wrench:. Briefly, this workflow encompasses

- beautiful scores engraved by [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org/),
- prefatory material typeset with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and
- compilation of editions via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container to ensure reproducibility.

Details on the workflow are available in the comprehensive [technical documentation](https://edition.esser-skala.at/about/technical-documentation) :mag:.
